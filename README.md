## CTFtime.org ranking points calculator

Simple Python script to calculate CTFtime.org ranking points from particular CTF event points based on formula from
https://ctftime.org/rating-formula/
There's an open issue for this here:
https://github.com/ctftime/ctftime.org/issues/25

This script will be updated when I'll be sure how this rating formula works (for now my script calculation are about 25-30% less than added points) :)

https://github.com/bl4de/ctf/blob/master/calculatePoints.py

For now calculated points are not relevant to added points in CTFtime.org ranking.
